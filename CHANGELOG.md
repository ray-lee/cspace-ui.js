## v2.0.0

v2.0.0 adds support for CollectionSpace 5.1.

### Breaking Changes

New fields have been added to the record editor forms for following record types: group, intake, loan in, loan out, and object exit. These fields exist in CollectionSpace 5.1, but not in prior versions of CollectionSpace. To use this version of cspace-ui with a 5.0 CollectionSpace server, these new fields should be hidden; otherwise, any values entered will not be saved. The following fields are new:

#### group
- `groupEarliestSingleDate`
- `groupLatestDate`

#### intake
- `approvalGroupList` and descendants

#### loan in
- `loanGroup` (in `loanStatusGroupList/loanStatusGroup`)
- `loanIndividual` (in `loanStatusGroupList/loanStatusGroup`)

#### loan out
- `loanGroup` (in `loanStatusGroupList/loanStatusGroup`)
- `loanIndividual` (in `loanStatusGroupList/loanStatusGroup`)

#### object exit
- `deaccessionApprovalIndividual` (in `deacApprovalGroupList/deacApprovalGroup`)
- `deaccessionApprovalNote` (in `deacApprovalGroupList/deacApprovalGroup`)
